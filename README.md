Food Order Application 

Hi, I'm Ali, and welcome to my site.

Here will import code for a program that order food using C++, and it's university project, and I wrote the Instructor's question.

Write a C++ program to take an online customer's order at a restaurant/café and 
display the total invoice amount, including delivery service and VAT. 
The program must interact with the user by giving him the possibility to select a 
restaurant/café (see pages 4 and 5). Next, the program should display the menu 
of the selected restaurant (with prices) and ask the user to select items to add to 
hist cart. The program must allow the user to repeat adding items in addition to 
the quantity of each item. Once the user is finished, the program should allow 
him to select checkout, where a distance to his home is entered to calculate the 
delivery charge (0.5 AED for each kilometer). The checkout should display the 
invoice including all previously selected items, their quantities, their total prices, 
delivery costs, VAT (%5) and the total amount.
